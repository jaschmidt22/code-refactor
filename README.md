# <Horiseon Marketing Webpage Code Refactoring>

## Description

I was given the task of refactoring the code behind the Horiseon Marketing webpage to make it more accessible. What is refactoring, you ask? Refactoring code means to improve the code without changing what it does. Web accessibilty ensures that people with disabilities are able to view a website using assistive technologies like a screen reader or video captions. Accessibilty is a very important feature for businesses to include in their websites. Having an accessible website ensures that a broader scope of customers are able to receive the information included in the site. It will also help to better situate the site within search engine results.
