# <Horiseon Marketing Webpage Code Refactoring>

## Description

I was given the task of refactoring the code behind the Horiseon Marketing webpage to make it more accessible. What is refactoring? Refactoring code means to improve the code without changing what it does. Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities are able to view a website using assistive technologies like a screen reader or video captions. Accessibility is a very important feature for businesses to include in their websites. Having an accessible website ensures that a broader scope of customers are able to receive the information included in the site. It will also help to better situate the site within search engine results. 


## Installation

N/A


## Usage

The Horiseon Marketing webpage has information on the services they provide, including Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. Since the site has been refactored with semantic elements, each section of the page will be clearly identified by assistive technologies. The content of the webpage is now sequentially ordered to improve performance of assistive technologies. Lastly, each image contained in the website now has a description that can be read by a screen reader for the visually impaired.
